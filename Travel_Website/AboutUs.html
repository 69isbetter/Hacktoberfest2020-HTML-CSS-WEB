                        <h3>I love to travel! Many of my fondest memories are from trips I’ve taken over the years.</h3>

                        <p>I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to travel quite extensively. During college, I spent a semester abroad in Florence. After college, I worked in a fishing village on the West Coast of Ireland. Here in the US, I have lived in various cities including San Francisco, Denver and St. Louis.</p>

                        <p>In each of these locations, I became an insider and gained a local’s perspective. This is what Wanderlust Travel Consultants does for our clients. Your travel experience will allow you to experience and appreciate the culture and vibe of your destination.</p>

                        <p>At Trippin' we understand that clients don’t necessarily have the time or expertise to arrange travel details- we will happily create your ideal trip for you.</p>

                      <h3>I blame my parents. They got me hooked on travel from a very young age…</h3>
                      <p>…starting with family trips to the US National Parks. Those trips were followed by forays to Europe, the Caribbean, and beyond. In total, I have visited 52 countries on 6 continents, and 50 states. </p>

                      <p>I like to focus on the natural landscape of each location as well as the food, people, and culture. I am intrigued by the opportunity to identify each location’s defining characteristics and then discovering the differences and similarities among the various locales.
                        I love the research and planning almost as much as the trip itself!</p>

                        <p>When Trippin' Travel Consultants plans your next vacation you can be sure that your trip will be personalized and spectacular!</p>
